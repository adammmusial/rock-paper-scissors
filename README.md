# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## About the Project
I created a simple Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript. The game is played between the user and the computer, where the first to score five points wins. The game announces the winner of each round and keeps track of the score. This project helped me learn about random number generation, conditionals, and loops in JavaScript.

## Features
- `getComputerChoice()`: Randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors for the computer's choice.
- `playRound(playerSelection)`: Plays a single round and returns the winner.
- `game()`: Manages the game flow, including score tracking and determining the overall winner.

## Key learnings:
- Random number generation for simulating computer choices
- Using conditionals and loops to manage game logic
- Handling user input and displaying results
- Implementing a simple game with a winning condition
